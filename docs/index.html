		<h2 class="section-heading">Our Philosophy</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Empathy has been our driving force for millennia. It let us survive savannas full of predators by having us look out for one another. Harsh winters were overcome by cooperation during harvests and strategic provisioning during storms. Even today, with the zero-sum game of Capitalism devouring our one and only planet, we still find solace in organizations that achieve what we cannot do alone, for the future of our species... to ensure we have a future at all.</p>
			<p>We need to keep utilizing empathy in order to understand and work together to overcome the challenges facing us â€“ and thrive despite them.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="section-heading">Our Mission</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>One of the greatest challenges we face is a rapidly deteriorating environment due to global climate change caused by relatively recent human activity. In order to stop further harm, one part of the solution is to build high-density, self-reliant housing projects.</p>
			<p>CastleTech exists to build humane tools for housing projects that enable considerate collaboration, the management and sharing of information, and informed decision-making at every level. With such tools in hand, these communities can become more friendly and efficient, giving them new abilities to address the needs of their residents effectively.</p>
