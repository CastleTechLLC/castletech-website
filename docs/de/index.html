		<div class="content">
			<p>Empathy has been our driving force for millennia. It let us survive savannas full of predators by having us look out for one another. Harsh winters were overcome by cooperation during harvests and strategic provisioning during storms. Even today, with the zero-sum game of Capitalism devouring our one and only planet, we still find solace in organizations that achieve what we cannot do alone, for the future of our species â€“ to ensure we have a future at all.</p>
			<p>We need to keep utilizing empathy in order to understand and work together to overcome the challenges facing us, and thrive despite them. One of those great challenges is a rapidly deteriorating environment due to global climate change caused by relatively recent human activity. In order to prevent further harm, one part of the solution is to use high-density, self-reliant cities to significantly reduce (and potentially eliminate) ecological footprint and overall impact.</p>

		<h2 class="section-heading">Mission</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>CastleTech exists to create human-centered software for dense urban living that enables considerate collaboration, property management, information sharing, and reasoned decision-making at every level.</p>
			<p>With such tools in hand, communities can focus more on benefitting people, giving them new abilities to address the needs of residents effectively. This will hopefully make urban living easier and more attractive, drawing more people into cities to live a healthier, more social life, encouraging empathy in everyone.</p>
