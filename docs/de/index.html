		<div class="content">
			<p>castle<strong>tech</strong> exists to create software for dense urban living that enables community collaboration, property management, information sharing, and reasoned decision-making at every level.</p>
			<p>With such tools in hand, communities can focus more on benefitting people to address the needs of residents effectively.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="section-heading">Philosophy</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Empathy has been our driving force for millennia. It let us survive savannas full of predators by having us look out for one another. Harsh winters were overcome by cooperation during harvests and strategic provisioning during storms. Even today, with the zero-sum game of Capitalism devouring our one and only planet, we still find solace in organizations that achieve what we cannot do alone, for the future of our species â€“ to ensure we have a future at all.</p>
			<p>We need to keep utilizing empathy in order to understand each other and work together to overcome the challenges facing us, and thrive despite them. One of those great challenges is a rapidly deteriorating environment due to global climate change caused by relatively recent human activity. In order to prevent further harm, one part of the solution is to use high-density, self-reliant cities to significantly reduce our ecological footprint and overall impact. We strive to achieve this goal with your help.</p>
