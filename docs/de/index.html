			<p>Empathy has been our driving force for millennia. It helped us survive the savannah full of predators by having us look out for one another. Harsh winters were overcome by cooperation during harvests and strategic provisioning during storms. Even today, with the zero-sum game of Capitalism devouring our one and only planet, we still find solace in organizations that achieve what we cannot do alone, for the future of our species... to ensure we have a future at all.</p>
			<p>We need to keep utilizing empathy to understand each other and work together to survive the challenges we face.</p>
			<p>CastleTech exists to develop tools and processes that enables empathy in everyone, guiding us towards cooperation. In order to stop damaging the environment that sustains us, we must build high-density, self-reliant communities to not simply reduce our footprint but start replenishing resources like food and electricity. To do this, we are building new tools to ensure considerate collaboration, the sharing of experiences and information, and efficient decision-making at every level so that these communities don't just survive, but thrive.</p>

It's a system designed to facilitate easy collaboration amongst residents, as well as bringing transparency to the entire community regardless if it's self-governing or if there's third-party managers.</p>
			<p>Going beyond property management, it's the neighborly app for bringing your community together.</p>
